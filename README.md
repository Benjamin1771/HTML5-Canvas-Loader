# HTML5-Canvas-Loader

<h3> Creating loaders on the HTML Canvas without a framework </h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment was to understand working without a framework on the html canvas. Frameworks make coding faster and simpler, but undertanding how much simpler the framework makes things is worth noting. </p>

<p>Below is a simple loader created on the canvas without a framework. It is very basic, and the .html file can be found in this repository.</p>

This loader animated accross the screen from left to right and repeats. To do this we need to introduce the canvas element in our code. The canvas element has an ID for css properties, and a height and width value determining its size.
